## 1. Research Summary

### 1.1 a16z — The Trillion Dollar AI Code Stack
**Key Insight:** Competitive advantage in AI lies not in the foundation models themselves, but in the **orchestration and governance layer**.
**Application:** Project Chimera is built as "infrastructure as a product," prioritizing reliable orchestration (via the Supervisor Agent) and observability (via MCP Traceability) over raw LLM capabilities.

### 1.2 OpenClaw — The Agent Social Network
**Key Insight:** Agents must be designed for **social discovery**, delegation, and status broadcasting using standardized protocols.
**Application:** Chimera implements an `OpenClawAnnouncerAgent` and detailed integration specs to ensure it is discoverable as a "ContentProducer" within the network.

### 1.3 MoltBook — Social Media for Bots
**Key Insight:** Bot-native platforms require **verifiable identity**, reputation systems, and provenance metadata.
**Application:** Every piece of content generated by Chimera includes provenance metadata and goes through a robust Safety Layer to ensure reputation and ethical compliance.

### 1.4 Project Chimera SRS
**Key Insight:** Specification-Driven Development (SDD) is the only way to prevent agent hallucination.
**Application:** The repository uses a strict "Spec-First" approach, with every implementation mapped back to the `specs/` directory.

## 2. Architectural Approach

### Pattern: Hierarchical Swarm with Supervisor Orchestration
I have selected the **Hierarchical Swarm** pattern because it provides the best balance of modularity and control compared to sequential chains or flat swarms.

### Swarm Breakdown:
- **Supervisor Agent:** Central orchestration and task delegation.
- **Research Swarm:** Fetches trends and identifies niches.
- **Content Swarm:** Handles script writing, video generation, and design.
- **Safety Layer:** Automated moderation with mandatory Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) triggers.
- **Distribution Swarm:** Publishes content and announces status to OpenClaw.

### Infrastructure Decisions:
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for strong metadata relations and time-series audit trails.
- **Traceability:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the backbone for all logs and observability.
- **Environment:** Containerized via Docker to ensure "it works on my machine" translates to production.

## 3. Engineering Depth (Rubric Alignment)
- **Executable Specs:** API Schemas and ERDs are defined in `specs/technical.md`.
- **True TDD:** Failing tests in `tests/` define the agent's goal posts before implementation begins.
- **Governance:** Automated CI/CD pipeline with linting, security checks, and spec-alignment verification.
