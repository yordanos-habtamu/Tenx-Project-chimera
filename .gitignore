# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#1173, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   poetry.lock
#   pyproject.toml is already handled in commit history.
